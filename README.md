# KZTierMapchooser
This is a modification of SourceMod's mapchooser, adding the tiers of maps in the vote menu

## Dependencies
This plugin uses:
- SourceMod 1.10.0
- SteamWorks (edited in include/, to use the latest SourcePawn declaration style)
- SMJansson (edited in include/, to use the latest SourcePawn declaration style)
- KZTimerGlobal.com's maps API

## TODO
- Add tiers to the !nominate menu
- Add a completion marker using KZTimerGlobal.com's players API
- Turn the edited part of this code into an easy to use API, so that any mapchooser could easily add tiers to its plugin
